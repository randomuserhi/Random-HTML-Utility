# Random HTML Utility (RHU)

A typescript library I use for making webpages the traditional way. It avoids the package hell of other libraries and relies on being simple to traditional web development.

**DISCLAIMER: This library is purely used for personal reasons and I add or remove features depending on my requirements. Use at your own risk.**
